# Window additions

### auto_hide

It gets back when gains focus.

Only the next events are able in minimized state:
 - gaining focus, `WindowEvent::Focused(true)`
 - suspending or resuming the application,
 `WindowEvent::Suspended` Ð¸ `WindowEvent::Resumed`
 - closing the window, `WindowEvent::Exit`
 - resizing the window, `WindowEvent::Resized(size)`

It's usefull for fullscreen application.
